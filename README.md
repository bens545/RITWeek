# What week is it at RIT?

Ever wonder what week number it is at RIT?  This is a simple page to tell you what week it is based off of the start of 
of the semester date.  It takes into account the weeks we don't have class (like Thanksgiving) and spits out an easy to
read week.

## Motivation

As a student at RIT I sometimes needed to kee track of what week it was, fortunately the institute provides no easy way
to figure this out.  I also wanted to give Vue.js a shot, so this project was commissioned.

## Tech Used

- Vue.js
- Moment.js
- Bulma (CSS)

## How to use

This project uses NPM for dependency management, and builds. 

Project setup
```
npm install
```

Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

## Credits

Thanks to Corbin Mailloux for creating `what-week`.  It's what this project is based off of, and original inspiration for
the application.
